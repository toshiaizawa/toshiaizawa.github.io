### Divestment Planner online app

This *Divestment Planner* helps users plan their divestment by creating to-do lists with timeline, and execute the plan with email reminders and online calendar integration.

Optionally, users can share their activities and achievements on social networks, such as Facebook, Line, and Twitter. That way divestment can go viral, and current and prospective users have more reasons to complete their divestment.

In the future, reviews/comments functionality can be added, and those stories shared by "senpai" (people who started earlier) can be navigate new users' journey.
